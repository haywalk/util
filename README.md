# Hayden's Utility Library

[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/haywalk/util/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/haywalk/util/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This is a utility library for Java programs, that I'm writing for practice and fun.

To use the library, put the `jar` file wherever you keep your libraries, and import `ca.haywalk.util.[class/subpackage]`.
